**Assignment: Applying Secure Design Principles to Code**

*Introduction:*
This assignment focuses on applying the eight principles of secure design proposed by Saltzer and Schroeder (1975) to code. Each principle contributes to the creation of robust and secure software systems. Below are the tasks to be performed.

### **Question 1: Code Examples**

#### 1.1 Principle of Least Privilege
Provide a code example that follows the Principle of Least Privilege and another that does not. Include a short explanation of the code's functionality, how the principle was enforced, and what caused the violation in the non-compliant code.

#### 1.2 Principle of Fail-Safe Defaults
Present a code snippet adhering to the Principle of Fail-Safe Defaults and another that neglects this principle. Explain the code's purpose, how the principle was implemented, and identify the reason for non-compliance in the second example.

#### 1.3 Principle of Economy of Mechanism
Offer a code sample illustrating the Principle of Economy of Mechanism and another that overlooks this principle. Clarify the code's function, the application of the principle, and the reason for non-compliance in the second code snippet.

#### 1.4 Principle of Complete Mediation
Demonstrate a code example embodying the Principle of Complete Mediation and one violating it. Provide concise explanations of the code's role, how the principle was maintained, and specify the non-compliance factor in the second code example.

#### 1.5 Principle of Separation of Privileges
Present a code instance adhering to the Principle of Separation of Privileges and another that violates it. Describe the code's functionality, the incorporation of the principle, and highlight the violation in the non-compliant code.

#### 1.6 Principle of Least Common Mechanism
Showcase a code example applying the Principle of Least Common Mechanism and one that doesn't. Briefly detail the code's purpose, the integration of the principle, and the aspect of the code leading to the violation in the second example.

### **Question 2: Security Mechanisms Analysis**

Explain which security principles are enforced by the following mechanisms. Provide a justification for your answer, emphasizing the principles without just listing them.

#### 2.1 Hardware Security Module
#### 2.2 Cuckoo Sandbox for Malware Analysis
#### 2.3 Access Control List in an Operating System
#### 2.4 Image Captcha on Flex
#### 2.5 Password Strength Indicator on Google or Similar Websites
#### 2.6 Biometric Authentication Required for a Banking App
#### 2.7 Design of Encryption Ciphers like AES (considering its history)
#### 2.8 Atomicity in Database Transactions
#### 2.9 Intrusion Detection Systems in Front of Public Facing Servers

### **Question 3: CVE Analysis**

Visit the CVE at the following link: [CVE-2007-0408](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2007-0408). Explain which principle violation is represented by this CVE.

### **Question 4: Least Common Mechanism in Real-world Scenarios**

#### 4.1 Air-gapping of Important Machines/Servers in Companies
#### 4.2 Cloudflare Protection for Websites
#### 4.3 The Colonial Pipeline Ransomware Attack

Explain how the Principle of Least Common Mechanism is either violated or enforced in the scenarios mentioned above.

*Conclusion:*
This assignment aims to deepen your understanding of secure design principles and their application in both code and real-world security mechanisms. Ensure to provide detailed explanations and justifications for your responses.
